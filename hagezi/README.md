## :zap: DNS Blocklists, let's make the internet a nicer place!

### Built with :heartbeat: for a safer, cleaner internet. It always looks impossible until someone just goes ahead and does it.

Privacy isn't a crime, so go protect yours. It's what lets you decide who you are and who you want to be :bangbang:

Like this project? If it's helped you out, drop a :star: (top right) and join the stargazers club! Every star genuinely helps.

### :books: **Multi, cleans up the internet and protects your privacy!** <a name="overview"></a>

This is an all-in-one DNS blocklist that comes in **several versions (light, normal, pro, pro++, and ultimate)**. You can run it standalone, and it works for any region. It blocks ads, affiliate links, trackers, metrics, telemetry, fake sites, phishing, malware, scams, cryptojacking, and other junk. It's built on [various source blocklists](sources.md), but that doesn't mean it's just a pile of lists glued together. Everything here has been optimized and extended so it actually cleans up the internet across the board.

Curious about the sources? Check out: [Which sources are used for the lists and how are they compiled?](FAQ.md#sources)

### :green_book: **Multi LIGHT**, **basic protection** <a name="light"></a>

Hand brush edition. Cleans up the internet and protects your privacy without going overboard. Blocks ads, trackers, metrics, and some badware. Basically a size-optimized version of Multi NORMAL.

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Relaxed
> This version shouldn't cause any real restrictions. Great if there's no admin around to unblock stuff for you, or if your ad blocker chokes on big lists.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Doesn't block error trackers like Bugsnag, Crashlytics, Firebase, Instabug, Sentry, and similar app crash reporters. Those only get blocked starting with the Pro version.

### :blue_book: **Multi NORMAL**, **all-round protection** <a name="normal"></a>

Broom edition. Cleans up the internet and protects your privacy. Blocks ads, affiliate links, trackers, metrics, telemetry, phishing, malware, scams, fakes, cryptojacking, and other junk.

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Relaxed/Balanced
> This one mostly won't cause restrictions either. Good pick if you don't have an admin handy to unblock anything.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Doesn't block error trackers like Bugsnag, Crashlytics, Firebase, Instabug, Sentry, and similar app crash reporters. Those only get blocked starting with the Pro version.

### :ledger: **Multi PRO**, **extended protection (recommended)** <a name="pro"></a>

Big broom edition. Cleans up the internet and protects your privacy. Blocks ads, affiliate links, trackers, metrics, telemetry, phishing, malware, scams, fakes, cryptojacking, and other junk.

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Balanced
> Restrictions here are rare. Works best if you've got an admin nearby who can unblock something if needed. This is my personal go-to recommendation for solid ad blocking with good privacy without much hassle.

> [!WARNING]
> **Referral domains (affiliate and tracking links):**
> Most referral domains are still allowed here, but a handful get blocked anyway, mainly ones that double as regular trackers or are commonly tied to scam and spam links. Details: [Referral domains](FAQ.md#referral)

### :orange_book: **Multi PRO++**, **maximum protection** <a name="proplus"></a>

Sweeper edition. This one cleans up the internet aggressively and protects your privacy hard. Blocks ads, affiliate links, trackers, metrics, telemetry, phishing, malware, scams, fakes, cryptojacking, and other junk.

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Balanced/Aggressive
> This is the more aggressive sibling of Multi PRO. It might block a few legit domains by mistake, so it's best for experienced users. Ideally have an admin ready to unblock things that break.

> [!WARNING]
> **Referral domains (affiliate and tracking links):**
> A handful of referral domains that double as regular trackers are blocked here too. Details: [Referral domains](FAQ.md#referral)

### :closed_book: **Multi ULTIMATE**, **aggressive protection** <a name="ultimate"></a>

Ultimate sweeper edition. Strictly cleans up the internet and locks down your privacy. Blocks ads, affiliate links, trackers, metrics, telemetry, phishing, malware, scams, fakes, cryptojacking, and other junk.

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocking type:** Aggressive
> This is a stricter version of Multi PRO++. It contains domains that can limit app or website functionality, including some popular trackers that will cause hiccups. Only use this if you know what you're doing, and make sure someone can unblock things when needed.

> [!WARNING]
> **Referral domains (affiliate and tracking links):**
> A few referral domains that also act as regular trackers get blocked. Details: [Referral domains](FAQ.md#referral)
>
> **Facebook:**
> Ultimate blocks some META trackers, which limits Facebook and Facebook Messenger app functionality. It also blocks WhatsApp's graph trackers, which can mess with avatar creation, the in-app help center, and video effects. Other than that, WhatsApp works fine. If you use META apps alongside Ultimate, unblock these domains as needed: [META Tracker](share/facebook.txt)
>
> **Windows/Xbox:**
> Some Microsoft trackers are blocked too, which can affect things like Windows Spotlight and Xbox Live Achievements Activity History. Check here for details on which domains to unblock for which feature: [Microsoft Tracker](share/microsoft.txt).
>
> **Location and IP trackers:**
> Certain trackers that websites use to pin down your IP or location get blocked. Great for privacy, but it might trigger wrong regional settings, extra CAPTCHAs, or reduced site functionality here and there. These trackers are usually used for hidden analytics and ad targeting.
>
> **Anything else:**
> More known quirks are listed [here](share/ultimate-known-issues.txt).

### :new: **Newly Registered Domains (NRD/DGA)** <a name="nrd"></a>

Newly registered domains (NRDs) are a favorite tool for threat actors running phishing, malware, and command-and-control operations, since these domains are easy to throw away and help dodge detection.

There are two variants:
- **NRDs:** every newly registered domain, no filtering.
- **Entropy NRDs/DGAs:** only newly registered domains with high entropy, meaning they were likely generated by a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). These have a random-looking structure and are commonly used by malware for resilient command-and-control channels.

> [!WARNING]
> These lists are big and resource-heavy. They can spike memory usage and include false positives, since some legit domains are new too. Use with care and whitelist important services if needed.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use these at your own risk. NRD lists come as-is, with no guarantees, no support, and no formal process for fixing false positives.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The base data comes from [Stamus Labs](https://www.stamus-networks.com/stamus-labs/subscribe-to-threat-intel-feed).
> Stamus Labs doesn't promise daily updates, so the data can sometimes lag by a few days.
>
> Current status of the data:
> - Stamus Labs: :green_circle: - Mon, 24 Aug 2026 04:25:16 UTC / 10839519 domains

### :computer: **Badware Hoster blocking, guards against malicious hosting services!** <a name="hoster"></a>

Blocks known hosting providers that repeatedly host badware through user-uploaded content.

> [!IMPORTANT]

>
> If you use this list, you're on your own for unblocking any subdomains you actually need.

> [!CAUTION]
> Blocking whole hosting providers is overkill for most setups and can break legit services. In high-security environments though, that trade-off might make sense.

### :crystal_ball: **Most Abused TLDs, blocks known shady top-level domains! (recommended)** <a name="tlds"></a>

Blocks the most abused top-level domains, combining data from Cloudflare Radar, Netcraft, and SpamHaus.

> [!WARNING]
> This list blocks entire top-level domains (like *.top, *.shop, *.gdn) that have a bad reputation overall. Yes, that means some legit sites get caught in the crossfire too, but it's really effective against spam, scams, phishing, malware, and other garbage. Know what you're signing up for.
>
> Only well-known, reputable domains that show up on major top lists (Umbrella, Cloudflare, Tranco, Chrome, DomCop, etc.) or are essential for popular apps get considered for exclusion. Illegal domains, including piracy sites, stay blocked no matter what. Anything that doesn't clearly qualify gets reviewed case by case, and if there's no good reason to unblock it, it stays blocked. If you need access to something specific, add it to your personal allowlist.
>
> This selective approach exists because AdGuard and uBlock Origin have technical limits on rule length when using denyallow/domain modifiers. Trying to exclude every legit domain would eventually break important rules, so exclusions have to stay limited and carefully picked.

### :shield: **DNS Rebind Protection, stops attackers from pointing domains at your local network!** <a name="dnsrebind"></a>

DNS Rebind Protection stops attackers from messing with DNS responses to make a domain point to a private or local IP address. This blocks malicious scripts from using DNS rebinding attacks to reach your internal network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This only works with AdGuard/AdGuard Home, and it's also selectable in AdGuard DNS.
> Other DNS blockers may already have their own rebind protection built in.
>
> Since rebind protection blocks anything resolving to a local IP, your internal hostnames might get caught too.
> In AdGuard, whitelist your local domains, something like: `@@||fritz.box^`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Native tracker lists cover everything used to monitor user activity, which can occasionally limit functionality too. They're integrated across all the standard tiers (Light, Normal, Pro, Pro++, Ultimate), each at a different blocking level:
>
> - Light through Pro: only block native trackers that won't break functionality, for a smooth experience.
> - Pro++ (aggressive): blocks extra native trackers that might cause some restrictions or limit certain features.
> - Ultimate: the most thorough option, blocking all native trackers for max privacy.
>
> Pick whichever tier matches how aggressive you want to be about native tracker blocking.
>
> When combining native tracker lists with the standard lists, you might need to manually unblock a specific tracker here or there.

### :bulb: **Recommendation** <a name="recommendation"></a>

For network-wide DNS blocking, I'd recommend [AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com), [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), [TechnitiumDNS](https://technitium.com/dns/), [Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky) (if you're comfortable with advanced setups), [adblock-lean](https://github.com/lynxthecat/adblock-lean) (for OpenWrt), or [eBlocker](https://eblocker.org/).

DNS blockers do a great job protecting your privacy by cutting off trackers, metrics, and telemetry. They can also block most ads, malware, scams, and fake sites, but they can't catch everything since some of that stuff doesn't work through DNS.

That's why I **also** recommend pairing this with a browser content blocker like [AdGuard](https://adguard.com), [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/), or [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/).

Check out Yokoffing's [Recommended Filters for uBlock Origin](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists) for good content blocker filter lists.

### :loudspeaker: **About** <a name="about"></a>

<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/graphs/contributors"><img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=hagezi/dns-blocklists&max=1" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>"If the plan doesn't work, change the plan, not the goal."<br>There's no place like 127.0.0.1!</b></i></p>

These blocklists are built on [various sources](sources.md) plus my own denylists and extensions. The goal has always been to avoid false positives as much as possible without giving up effectiveness. Dead entries get pruned regularly to keep the lists lean.
Built with :heartbeat: for a safer, cleaner internet.

Every list gets tested against 10,000 websites from the Cisco Umbrella Top 1 million list. I check whether pages load properly, content displays correctly, navigation works, images load, videos play, and so on.

So no, these aren't just random lists stitched together from other sources. They've been optimized and extended to genuinely clean up the internet across every category. Curious how? Check out: [Which sources are used and how are the lists compiled?](FAQ.md#sources)

Here's how each version performed against the 10,000 [whotracks.me](https://whotracks.me/websites.html) pages. All pages were opened and fully loaded in batch via Edge with privacy features turned off, and cookies accepted.

| **List**     | Total queries | Blocked queries | % blocked | % gap to light |

| **Pro++**    | 299646        | 119681          | 39.94     | 9.05           |

| **Light**    | 299646        | 92576           | 30.90     |                |

#### :octocat: Repository <a name="repository"></a>

The repository gets compressed (reinitialized) every now and then to keep its size in check. Heads up, this invalidates forks and wipes the commit history.

#### :cyclone: Referral Domains <a name="referral"></a>

Wondering why referral domains (affiliate and tracking links) aren't blocked? Here's the answer: [FAQ on referral domains](FAQ.md#referral)

#### :dizzy: Support <a name="support"></a>

If this project has been useful to you, drop a :star: (top right) and join the stargazers!

This project only exists because of a genuinely supportive community. It's free for everyone and stays up to date thanks to ongoing care, updates, and contributions from people who actually want to make things better.

Feedback, ideas, domain reports, false-positive reports, whatever you've got, it's all appreciated. Every bit of help, big or small, makes the internet a little safer and cleaner for everyone.

### :floppy_disk: Update Interval/Official Mirrors <a name="mirrors"></a>

The primary source for all lists is the GitHub repository. The GitHub repository and its two full mirrors, GitLab and Codeberg, are updated in sync, once a day:

| Source | Update frequency |
|:---|:---|
| GitHub/jsDelivr (primary) | Once a day |
| [gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror](https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror) | Once a day, in sync with GitHub |
| [codeberg.org/hagezi/mirror2](https://codeberg.org/hagezi/mirror2) | Once a day, in sync with GitHub |
| [hagezi-mirror.dnsbunker.org](https://hagezi-mirror.dnsbunker.org) | Every 4 to 8 hours |

> [!TIP]
> If you need the freshest possible data, use [hagezi-mirror.dnsbunker.org](https://hagezi-mirror.dnsbunker.org). It's connected directly to the build system and receives each new list version as soon as it's built, ahead of the daily GitHub, GitLab, and Codeberg update.

### :warning: Disclaimer <a name="disclaimer"></a>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Scope.** This disclaimer applies only to these DNS blocklists ("the Lists"). It does not extend to any other services the Provider may separately operate (e.g., public DNS resolvers), which may be subject to their own terms.
>
> **No warranty.** The Lists are provided free of charge, "as is" and "as available," with no warranty of any kind, express, implied, or statutory. The creator/operator of the Lists ("the Provider") makes no promises about accuracy, completeness, timeliness, reliability, or fitness for any particular purpose. There's no guarantee that every malicious or unwanted domain is covered, and no guarantee that legitimate domains won't get blocked by mistake. The Lists are compiled in part from third-party sources; the Provider does not control and is not responsible for errors originating in those sources.
>
> **Assumption of risk.** Using the Lists is entirely at your own risk. The Provider disclaims any and all direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential liability for damages arising from using, misusing, or being unable to use the Lists, except where such damages result from willful misconduct or gross negligence on the Provider's part, or from death or personal injury caused by the Provider's negligence.
>
> **A supplement, not a substitute.** The Lists are meant to be one part of a broader defense-in-depth strategy, not the whole thing. They don't replace your own responsibility to do due diligence, run your own risk assessments, or use additional protections (firewalls, antivirus/EDR, IDS/IPS, etc.). There's no guarantee of compatibility with any specific system, platform, or setup.
>
> **No guarantee of availability, fair use.** The Lists are a free, personal/community project, made available internationally, and no one is automatically entitled to their continued availability. The Provider may modify, suspend, restrict, or discontinue the Lists (in whole or in part) at any time and for any reason, including excessive query volume or abusive or disproportionate use, without notice and without liability, and is under no obligation to maintain, update, or continue providing them. The Provider makes reasonable efforts to fix faults once discovered, but does not guarantee any particular response or resolution time.
>
> **Redistribution and licensing.** The Lists are published under the [GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). A copy of the license is also included in each repository or mirror distributing the Lists. You may redistribute, modify, and adapt the Lists only under the terms of that license. This disclaimer applies in addition to, and does not replace, the warranty and liability terms already contained in the GPL-3.0 (Sections 15 to 16). It's on you to read, understand, and follow the license terms before using or redistributing anything.
>
> **Governing law.** The Provider is based in Germany, and the Lists are made available for international use. This disclaimer is governed by the laws of Germany, without regard to conflict-of-law principles, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing in this disclaimer limits any mandatory consumer-protection rights you may have under the law of your country of residence.
>
> **Severability.** If any provision of this disclaimer is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect, and the invalid provision will be replaced by a valid one that most closely reflects its intended effect.
>
> **Changes to this disclaimer.** The Provider may update this disclaimer from time to time. The version published alongside the Lists at the time of your access or use applies. Continued use of the Lists after an update constitutes acceptance of the updated disclaimer.
>
> **Accepting these terms.** By accessing, downloading, or using these DNS blocklists, you agree to be bound by everything laid out in this disclaimer. If you do not agree, do not access, download, or use the Lists.
